These are some passing notes taken while listening to Tim Keller's Sermon, "Worship", based on Psalm 95.

Worship should be a corporate event. Psalm 95 is written in the plural form: "Let us sing...let us make a joyful noise....let us come....let us worship....let us kneel...do not harden your hearts." 

But why can't I worship in private? The internet makes this convinent and very doeable. What if I just don't like people? is this necessary? 

C.S. Lewis gives us good reasons: 
> “In each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself I am not large enough to call the whole man into activity; I want other lights than my own to show all his facets. Now that Charles is dead, I shall never again see Ronald’s [Tolkien’s] reaction to a specifically Charles joke. Far from having more of Ronald, having him “to myself” now that Charles is away, I have less of Ronald…In this, Friendship exhibits a glorious “nearness by resemblance” to heaven itself where the very multitude of the blessed (which no man can number) increases the fruition which each of us has of God. For every soul, seeing Him in her own way, doubtless communicates that unique vision to all the rest. That, says an old author, is why the Seraphim in Isaiah’s vision are crying “Holy, Holy, Holy” to one another (Isaiah 6:3). The more we thus share the Heavenly Bread between us, the more we shall have.”

And so, arguing from lesser to greater, using C.S. Lewis's insight, Keller argues that:
1. You can only know a full person in a fellowship, bc/ you only see the part of that person that you bring out. The more you share a friend with friends, the more of that person you have. 
2. If a finite human being needs to be known corporately, how much more God? 
3. Worshipping with the other people is our best shot at having the most complete picture of God. 

And that is the aim of all Christians, isn't it?

title: The Betrayers

In Mark 14, Jesus predicts his betrayal by one disciple, and he predicts the defection and the failure of all the disciples. So what are we supposed to learn from this?

Even though it will be relevant to everybody, this passage is particularly meant for people who think they are Jesus’ friends, people who think they’re pretty close to him, people who feel they’re really following him, people who even would consider themselves the leaders of the Christian movement.

This passage teaches us about 1) [[the breadth of sin]], 2) [[the depth of sin]], and 3) [[how to overcome it]].
